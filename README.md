# expressnotejotterapp
A swift and intuitive solution for capturing and organizing your notes on-the-go

## Description 
This application is designed for jotting down, reviewing, and erasing notes.  

The purpose of this venture is to craft API endpoints using the Express.js server framework in conjunction with Node.js and to ensure the application is live on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs). 
  
The `routes.js` file encompasses the following endpoints:  
- A GET endpoint to deliver all stored notes to the user:  
`app.get('/api/notes', (req, res) => {...});`

- A POST endpoint to accept a new note from the user's input, incorporate it into the `db.json` file, and then relay the added note back to the user:  
`app.post('/api/notes', (req, res) => {...});`

- A DELETE endpoint to erase a specific note identified by the id parameter from the `db.json` file, followed by transmitting the refreshed list of notes to the user: 
`app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (req, res) => {})`

- An HTML endpoint to provide the `notes.html` page: 
`app.get('/notes', (req, res) => {...})`

- An HTML endpoint for default requests, serving the `index.html` page: 
`app.get('*', (req, res) => {})`

![Page with existing notes listed in the left-hand side of the screen and two empty fields to enter new note in the right-hand side of the screen](Assets/notes-page.png)  
  
When the user enters a note title and note text, buttons to "Save Note" and "Clear Form" will appear at the top of the page. The "Clear Form" button will erase the entered title and text from the right-hand column.
